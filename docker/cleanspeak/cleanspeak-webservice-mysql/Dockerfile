# CleanSpeak Webservice (with MySQL connector) Dockerfile

# Normally the mysql-connector jar is downloaded at runtime due to licensing,
# in this case the mysql connector jar will be baked into the image. As a result,
# this images CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED due to the GPL license of the connector jar.
# We will only ship this file so that people can build the images themselves and
# thus avoid the license issues.
#

#   > docker build --build-arg MYSQL_CONNECTOR_VERSION=8.0.18 -t cleanspeak/cleanspeak-webservice-mysql:latest .
